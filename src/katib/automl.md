# Automatic Machine Learning

Applied Machine Learning is a highly iterative process. When you are training a neural network you have to make a lot of choices - like how many layers does the network have, how many hidden units should have, what is the learning rate, what is the activation function etc. It is almost impossible to correctly guess the correct values all these hyperparameters. Intuitions from one domain do not apply well to another domain.
When training a machine learning model, we want to optimize the in-sample error (Bias) and the out-of-sample error(variance). In the past we often saw that improving the bias resulted in over-fitting and high variance and vice versa.
With the rise of neural networks and big data, improving bias and variance together has become feasible. We can build larger neural networks to reduce bias and train them with more data to reduce variance. How ever this exacerbates the problem of selecting optimal hyperparameters and neural network architectures. This make automatic machine learning more desirable, but also feasible as we do not have to deal with the bias/variance trade off.
