# Setup Prerequisites

### Goals
In this section we will setup a single node Kubernetes cluster.

`You can skip this section if you have an existing Kubernetes cluster with a dynamic volume provisioner.`

### Overview 

[Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For this tutorial we will setup a single node Kubernetes cluster using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).


### Prerequisites

* Vagrant 2.2.5 or later
* VirtualBox 6.0.14 or later
* Laptop or server with at least 4 CPU cores and 16 Gig of RAM
